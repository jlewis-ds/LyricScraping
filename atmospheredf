couple laps around the campground and hoofed down the path i figure youll return no concern imma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn the wind is blowing strong minutes rolling on its going on at least a half an hour youve been gone  4 it aint right start the paranoia i left the camp site to go and search for ya i read the trail your feet made each step was deliberately placed it looks like you know where it leads but i see nothing but leafless frozen trees about a quarter mile into the course another set of tracks appeared next to yours from the north it came out of the thick woods and those footprints belong to a big wolf  5 trying to find service on my cellphone i felt aight with my knife on my belt though i hope the wolf is intimidated by you i wondered if you even knew what was behind you stalking ya maybe watching ya waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya salivating wanna take ya to the stomach in the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick  6 and it gets about as bad it goes cause i notice theres a new set of tracks in the snow i understood it doesnt look good your fan club doubled now youve got another wolf and the odds are in favor of the home team whyd you walk off all alone where you going it aint the right time to complain but it feels like im trying to find your remains  7 your foot prints grew further apart i knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart it means you started to run so i did the same now my breaths looking like a steam engine train suddenly your tracks dip off of the path and so did theirs so my knife i grabbed into the forest expect the worst adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves  8 50 yards into the woods and brush it got so thick that it looked like dusk the air stood serene sober it seemed like a good 15 degrees colder and ill admit hell yeah i felt fear the sound of my heart beat was all i could hear looking at the snow it was plain and clear there was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared  9 i cant process i dont follow it would be easier to believe that you were swallowed with no sign of death no sign of struggle no signs of blood no signs of trouble and the wolves never stopped the tracks kept going and i took off so i dont know how your story ends but i know ill never go into those woods again chorus its not that tragic its not a shame youre not the hunted youre not the aim you just another dog with hunger pains i was so afraid that youd become the game i forgot to worry about what you became youre not the hunted youre not the aim you just another dog with hunger

me paint a picture on the surface of your mind i got a job at the circus and i quit writing rhymes now i travel from city to city life of a gypsy gravel grass concrete folklore and mystery yo looking at my gucci its about that time for me to pawn this piece of junk and try to pay some of these fines fly angel fly dont ever look back you better scoop that dead rat off the track go home and cook that maybe you should trade that mustang for a jeep so when you get too drunk to drive youll have a dry place to sleep dont forget what chocolate milk does to the hangover come on who you think cut the tires on your land rover twist the nobs and chew the fat off the shish kebab ditch the lard that cut my hair and made me quit my job and if i pass before they get a chance to hear me tell em kiss my ass and teach em all about my theory  4x choking on a wishbone position blown out the frame pissed on the remains to mark the spot and spark the flame  it never settles the constant grinding of metal against complicated timing developing my threshold touching the gestalt with a little reverb and some echo to add extra flavor like pesto yo the cards are dealt and now im staring at my hand

carry me through the meaninglessness here i am with the word extracting nerves running toward the stage here we go to watch the crash occur    put your head on the pillow and shut your eyes take your mind out the ghetto and touch the sky then come ease down that much feared trail of blood sweat and love instead of flame crying tears in the rain the thunder came and it drowned out the hunger pains numbed the brain and played life like a numbers game poppa needs a new pair of nuts cause he lost touch with the last ones fastened to the bottom of his guts yo they dont know me its best that way let em look for tomorrow in yesterday this child is your fate so let em play i bet i know your age and i can guess your weight wait wait how can it be so simple and straight and why the hell aint you tripping to make some ripples in the lake i cant figure it out for gods sake arguing a lost case as it irritates my prostate and when i sit home alone i kick over the telephone and catch my zone

enable you to deal without schooling you on how to touch whats real and if i was a smart man id tell you everything that i knew and give it to you every time you need a talking to but what would that do teach you my guidelines so you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines and if i was a driver id keep my headlights on to see the difference between right and wrong id wear my seatbelt even when im in park cause i dont trust the other fools that cruise through these parts and if i was a better cook id  up a feast set a table full of food for the children to eat i encourage the nourishment so we can breathe with the knowledge that we got something accomplished  and if i was santa claus id fight for the cause wouldnt expect nothing in return id give you everything you want id be everything you need so you can take my hand and i can take the lead and if i was an honest man i would stop writing songs id break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast tell everyone i knew to stay away from making music it aint nothing but a confusing mess confusing mess and if i was you i wouldnt hear a word i said wouldnt trust nothing to start it up inside my head id make a conscious effort to live instead of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed and if i was a hurt man id find a way to put my faith into a woman that could take me from today maybe i need somebody that could save me from the parts of myself that keep making me crazy and if i was a wise man id climb to the top of the mountain peak to think about strength versus weakness id find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head and figure out how i could try to help you reach it ho ho ho and if i did have a choice id never want to live forever just let me have a voice so i can make my points i cant imagine running a race with no finish line just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time i love giving but im bad at receiving the truth is id prefer to be the one bleeding but im a paranoid that stays between play and work cautious and aware cause im afraid of being hurt which brings me to the issue and that would be this how often must i ask myself why i exist i feel like a freak this world is a circus just trying to find myself as well as my purpose  repeat  and if i was santa claus id fight for the cause wouldnt expect nothing in return id give you everything you want id be everything you need and you can take my hand and i can take the lead i got nothing but gifts keep it up in my wits got me drunk on the fifth and now were stuck in a ditch and as dumb as it gets
