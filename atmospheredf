1,Brief Description,7391,200,https://genius.com/Atmosphere-brief-description-lyrics, sample have you heard it sing along if you didnt hear it youre gonna hear it right now  1  bam the doorway opened for me i saw ways and told the story raw daydreams of holding glory junior high hallway kings locking bagging mcs beat boxing breaking zulu nation wannabees it didnt take long to see who would stay strong high school came upon some b boys put their gang bangs on but some kept on doing stepped on to ruin others that were pursuing the same shit we thought we ruled in but what a surprise the passion for being the best puts a quest for allies to rest dead in the midwest where heads is just a handful in a land of gangstas players replacements priests banjos we scramble to break mcs that may appreciate it guided by their envy insecurity and their hatred separated by the gimmie props technique and the desire to be the tops this week i gotta floss the speak cause talk is cheap even the broke kids can afford it thats why i stand close and if youre dope then im supportive but if not well keep the mic warm for the next one respect the artform and make your wishes on the stars born  within the movement fact checking trying to completely avoid all channels of backstepping from the lines of painted concrete that reside on lake street to the way we close our eyes to sleep and drift through deep space 9 type shit to find this ive been around for as long as sound ive been to that not so fresh phase and to that not quite that serious state but ive evolved metamorphed manifestate  2  i used to be young dumb and full of vision like it was religious rituals i made initial decisions i wanted to be a rapper world renowned from minneap to the bronx capture girls and crowns snap tackle and stomp thats when i found the abyss that sits in between the one that holds the mic and those that dont even listen formed some crews rocked talent shows at schools saturdays on the 18 making my way down to the record pool i met a grip of people that was bullshit was down with a lot of people that was bullshit but ill pull shit from the asshole of an angel before i let him hassle and strangle the love triangle between me the mic and the turntable went to studios we want to make demos we want to do shows and rock our own instrumentals do our own production fucking around with this kid kazir nitwit engineer barely knew his own equipment atmosphere the prefix was urban wrecked shows made friends made foes overall we made flows and right now as i sit here right now writing this im bugging off the people in my life that made me like this  within the movement fact checkin tryin to completely avoid all channels of backsteppin from the lines of painted concrete that reside on franklin ave to the dead bird on the elevator to that short in your crossfader i never got lost later for efforts to pester just throw your hands up in the air like a leper ive been to that not so fresh phase and to that not quite that serious state metamorph and manifestate  3  well sometimes it rings and i dont answer it thats it no asterisk no thirst to find the circumstances it was planted in me deep it was nurtured and it grew gave it sleep and nutrition it was efficient let it through theres a few that have developed to where i let them in my spectrum for the rest of em i give them just enough to cause infection not tripping on attention but if you have it its welcome open arms potent charm i know the words and i can spell them seldom is it when one inquisits do they leave with disinterest in fact most begin crave the visits bringin me to the table thats it no more no less the love the life the stress  the mic the mess testing yes ive been tested and ive tested some not saying im the best believe im not like the rest of em just saying im better than you thats my mind state my rhymes take me into when i check one two i guess some do get pissed but intentions were to inspire build the empire before i get tired the ones that tear me down dont know it but theyre the same ones that built me now quietly in your head say yes you can feel me sample asking himself even before the curtain goes up what am i i am now 80 years old and more and i am determined to find precisely what i am what i amount to they tell me i am everything they flatter me every day of my life i am now going to subject myself to a rigorous test in order to find out really what i am i dont care about kingdom i dont care about rule anymore it is of no importance to me as such but i must find out what i am before i die ,sample heard sing along didnt hear youre gonna hear right 1 bam doorway opened saw ways told story raw daydreams holding glory junior high hallway kings locking bagging mcs beat boxing

22,If I Was Santa Claus,5001,200,https://genius.com/Atmosphere-if-i-was-santa-claus-lyrics,  if i was a rich man id buy you some shoes tall boots for all the dirt you walk through what would that do enable you to deal without schooling you on how to touch whats real and if i was a smart man id tell you everything that i knew and give it to you every time you need a talking to but what would that do teach you my guidelines so you can be a cheerleader at your game on the sidelines and if i was a driver id keep my headlights on to see the difference between right and wrong id wear my seatbelt even when im in park cause i dont trust the other fools that cruise through these parts and if i was a better cook id  up a feast set a table full of food for the children to eat i encourage the nourishment so we can breathe with the knowledge that we got something accomplished  and if i was santa claus id fight for the cause wouldnt expect nothing in return id give you everything you want id be everything you need so you can take my hand and i can take the lead and if i was an honest man i would stop writing songs id break for a nervous breakdown for breakfast tell everyone i knew to stay away from making music it aint nothing but a confusing mess confusing mess and if i was you i wouldnt hear a word i said wouldnt trust nothing to start it up inside my head id make a conscious effort to live instead of trying to kill the monsters that reside underneath the bed and if i was a hurt man id find a way to put my faith into a woman that could take me from today maybe i need somebody that could save me from the parts of myself that keep making me crazy and if i was a wise man id climb to the top of the mountain peak to think about strength versus weakness id find a point that rests a couple of feet above your head and figure out how i could try to help you reach it ho ho ho and if i did have a choice id never want to live forever just let me have a voice so i can make my points i cant imagine running a race with no finish line just let me keep my pace and make to most of my time i love giving but im bad at receiving the truth is id prefer to be the one bleeding but im a paranoid that stays between play and work cautious and aware cause im afraid of being hurt which brings me to the issue and that would be this how often must i ask myself why i exist i feel like a freak this world is a circus just trying to find myself as well as my purpose  repeat  and if i was santa claus id fight for the cause wouldnt expect nothing in return id give you everything you want id be everything you need and you can take my hand and i can take the lead i got nothing but gifts keep it up in my wits got me drunk on the fifth and now were stuck in a ditch and as dumb as it gets imma run you some fibs i wanna touch your lips i wanna rub your hips put a glove on the fist for the love that exists well keep bumping the hits to get my bucket of chips from the bloods and the crips

vegetables bite back and the grass starts to sting i yell up to heaven to get me the hell out of this dream i fell out of my stream of self consciousness and i got welts on my mind to signify all my accomplishments no matter whose math you use to count the dead progress will never rest in the hand that has no head bought my brain a cane and asked it to be my pimp you know to make sure i dont get stuck up in my fuck ups a little overanxious i was to bust nuts and find the answers making love out of a canvas full of touch ups i dip my brush into the what ive wept for and wonder out loud as i can how long ive slept for i should rob a pet store let the dogs wild i should close all the schools just to make the kids smile seize the limit let the sky be the moment put the key to the ignition ima ride these donuts and when it breaks lock the door walk away wont be nothin else to talk about nothin else to say chorus im just waitin for the moment i can break away the only reason that i stay

they like to hurt my pride while i work their nerves once upon a time it was worth it when the urges get fed and the purpose finds a path to the surface is respect considered a breakfast food im guilty of the type of attitude that wrecks your mood the truth can be pain and i hate to do it either face the music or get away from me stupid super glue it down now it better not move see im not the best but im in the top two and im not that friendly when this cup is empty its a side effect from trying to find the fucks that sent me see i didnt just happen i was made this way by the same egomaniac that paved this way chorus see im just waitin for the moment i can break away the only reason that i stay so i can save the day im just waitin for the moment i can break away the only reason that i stay so i can save the day  3 see i gave up lying but i still tiptoe im as stubborn as they come and im known to hit low if i had a chisel i would carve out a hole for me to hide in every time the mighty wind blows since no one knows where the hell we gonna go ima stand right here until the end of the show ima clap my hands so dont pass the chance to unsnap my pants get on my lap and dance no longer am i mad about the things i dont have all im living for is love and laughs the last starfighters weapons were rendered useless so we pulled the scissors and cut the cord to end this music music fades out fades in and out again outro you want the fucking window rolled up you roll up the fucking window you piece of shit dont fucking talk to me like that dont fucking talk to me at all you

down barbeque in the backyard the kids get treats and old folks get classic cars every day that gets to pass is a success and every woman looks better in a sun dress the sunshines an excuse to shoot hoops get juice show improve their moves and let loose i hear voices i see smiles to match em good times and you can feel it in the fashion even though the heat cooks up the action the streets still got butterflies enough kids to catch em ridin my bike around these lakes man feelin like i finally figured out my escape plan take it all and the day started off all wrong somehow now that hangover is

at least a half an hour youve been gone  4 it aint right start the paranoia i left the camp site to go and search for ya i read the trail your feet made each step was deliberately placed it looks like you know where it leads but i see nothing but leafless frozen trees about a quarter mile into the course another set of tracks appeared next to yours from the north it came out of the thick woods and those footprints belong to a big wolf  5 trying to find service on my cellphone i felt aight with my knife on my belt though i hope the wolf is intimidated by you i wondered if you even knew what was behind you stalking ya maybe watching ya waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya salivating wanna take ya to the stomach in the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick  6 and it gets about as bad it goes cause i notice theres a new set of tracks in the snow i understood it doesnt look good your fan club doubled now youve got another wolf and the odds are in favor of the home team whyd you walk off all alone where you going it aint the right time to complain but it feels like im trying to find your remains  7 your foot prints grew further apart i knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart it means you started to run so i did the same now my breaths looking like a steam engine train suddenly your tracks dip off of the path and so did theirs so my knife i grabbed into the forest expect the worst adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves  8 50 yards into the woods and brush it got so thick that it looked like dusk the air stood serene sober it seemed like a good 15 degrees colder and ill admit hell yeah i felt fear the sound of my heart beat was all i could hear looking at the snow it was plain and clear there was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared  9 i cant process i dont follow it would be easier to believe that you were swallowed with no sign of death no sign of struggle no signs of blood no signs of trouble and the wolves never stopped the tracks kept going and i took off so i dont know how your story ends but i know ill never go into those woods again chorus its not that tragic its not a shame youre not the hunted youre not
